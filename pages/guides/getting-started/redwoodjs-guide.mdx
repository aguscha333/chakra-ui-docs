### 1. Setup

Getting stated with Chakra UI in RedwoodJs is as easy as running the following
command:

```bash
yarn rw setup ui chakra-ui
```

Under the hood this command installs the necessary packages, sets up the Chakra
provider and configures the lib to work with Storybook so you can start creating
components right away.

### ChakraProvider Props

After setting up Chakra UI, if you check out your `App.js` file you'll see that
the `ChakraProvider` has been set up for you there.

In case you need to do some further adjustments, it is good to know that these
are the props that it accepts:

| Name             | Type             | Default               | Description                                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| resetCSS         | `boolean`        | `true`                | automatically includes `<CSSReset />`               |
| theme            | `Theme`          | `@chakra-ui/theme`    | optional custom theme                               |
| colorModeManager | `StorageManager` | `localStorageManager` | manager to persist a users color mode preference in |
| portalZIndex     | `number`         | `undefined`           | common z-index to use for `Portal`                  |

> Boom! You're good to go ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€. However, if you'd love to take it a step
> further, check out step 2.

### 2. Optional Setup

- Customizing Theme

If you intend to customise the default theme object to match your design
requirements, you can extend the `theme` from `@chakra-ui/react`.

Chakra UI provides an `extendTheme` function that deep merges the default theme
with your customizations.

```jsx live=false
// 1. Import the extendTheme function
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react'

// 2. Extend the theme to include custom colors, fonts, etc
const colors = {
  brand: {
    900: '#1a365d',
    800: '#153e75',
    700: '#2a69ac',
  },
}

const theme = extendTheme({ colors })

// 3. Pass the `theme` prop to the `ChakraProvider`
function App() {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
      <FatalErrorBoundary page={FatalErrorPage}>
        <RedwoodApolloProvider>
          <Routes />
        </RedwoodApolloProvider>
      </FatalErrorBoundary>
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

> To further customize components or build your own design system, the
> `theme-tools` package includes useful utilities. Install
> `@chakra-ui/theme-tools`.

- Using Chakra Icons

Chakra provides a set of commonly used interface icons you can use in your
project.

If you want to use the icons from Chakra UI, install `@chakra-ui/icons`.

> Follow this guide for customising Chakra Icons
> [Using Chakra UI Icons](/docs/components/media-and-icons/icon).

#### Notes on TypeScript ðŸš¨

Please note that when adding Chakra UI to a TypeScript project, a minimum
TypeScript version of `4.1.0` is required.
